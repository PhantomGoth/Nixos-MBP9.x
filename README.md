# Nixos-MBP9.x

Heyo! I'm new to linux and NixOS. Trying to set upt NixOS as my first distro on my old mid-2012 MBP.
I will probably get very much annoyed in this journey as it seems setting up NixOS on a mbp seems to be quite a task at hand.

I haven't yet comitted to running it on bare metal as I'm planning to do some upgrades to the laptop which means in the meantime it's all just tests in the VM.
